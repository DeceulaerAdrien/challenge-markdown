### You can always count on me when you dont know

You can always count on me to explain.

I always share my knowledge with others when I have this knowledge.

### Funny story

One day when I was 4 years old, I went to an exhibition about the pharaohs.Back home I thought I was an explorer, All proud I go see parents and I tell them "one day I would be a gynecologist to be able to visit the pyramids"
They’ve been laughing at me for 18 years

#### TL;DR:  

An ignorant child will always say nonsense that will follow him all his life. 
And I know what I’m talking about
